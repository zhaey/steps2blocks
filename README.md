Simple GUI app for converting stepmania charts to Beat Saber maps.

Developed with Python 3.9 on Linux. It should work fine on Windows, but I don't test it on there myself so let me know
if there are any issues.

Executable zip file releases created by running the following command in the project
root: `python -m zipapp -p "/usr/bin/env python3" steps2blocks`.
